# SecondEngineProject
A framework I am developing to learn and experiment with Graphics and Engine Architecture.

Features:
Multithreaded renderer architecture - Command driven renderer, loading assets is done on a different thread, complete separation in plan.
Custom pure C++ Unreal-like delegates implemented using templates.
Timers system.

## Libs:
- GLFW
- Glad
- EASTL
- GTest
- Assimp
- stb_image
